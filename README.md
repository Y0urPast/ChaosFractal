# ChaosFractal
This application facilitates the generation of fractals, such as the Sierpinski triangle, by employing the chaos method. Users can define starting points which serve as the vertices for the fractal's construction. The app iteratively generates new points by randomly selecting one of these vertices and plotting the subsequent point at the midpoint towards it, gradually building up the complex and captivating fractal pattern.
